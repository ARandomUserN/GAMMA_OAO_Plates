		<text>Soft fabric kevlar plates designed to be worn as light body armor or used as supplementary protection under heavier plates. Kevlar is widely known for their protective capabilities, and are highly valued because of their incredible strength-to-weight ratio. They perform a wide variety of functions, the most important of which is absorbing the impact of firearm projectiles on the front and the back of the torso. While incredibly lightweight and effective against small-caliber handgun rounds, they are easily defeated by any rifle round.\n \n

		<text>A set of extremely heavy hardened-steel armor inserts. While they will protect against some high-caliber rounds, have good multi-hit capability, and are reasonably cheap, these benefits come at the cost of high weight. For this reason, soldiers of armies have opted for lighter ceramic inserts, while steel inserts such as these are mainly purchased by civilians. In the Zone, steel plates like these are a principal component of exoskeleton body armor, as the support structure easily offsets the great weight. These plates can also be worn to supplement ordinary body armor, but doing so is extremely cumbersome.\n \n%c[d_red]\n\n%c[d_red]WARNING:%c[ui_gray_2]\n \n%c[default]Steel is a conductor and its proximity to the skin makes the body more vulnerable to electricity.
